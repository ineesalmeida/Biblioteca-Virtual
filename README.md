# Biblioteca Virtual

## What it is
This is a simple Flask app I built for my mom to store information about all her books.
It uses Flask + SQLAlchemy + Pyinstaller to create an executable, local web app to manager her online library.

This was a simple fun project I started with the goal of learning Flask and making a nice thing for my mom :)

## How to use
Run the build > app executable. That will open a browser window with the app.

## Functionality
You can add, delete and edit book information. You can also export the book database to a CSV file.
